        	<p>This is a drawing of a phonograph record and the location of it's stylus. The lines that surround the disk is binary arithmetic, meant to show that the record should be played at the proper speed of 3.6 seconds per rotation. The line segments pointing radially outwards from the circle represents a 1, and the line segments that are tangent to the circle represents a 0.</p>

            <p>The binary arithmetic is expressed using the time unit as the time period of a fundamental transition of a hydrogen atom. This time period is also referenced in the drawing of the hydrogen atom on the lower right hand corner of the record.</p>

            <p>There are a listing of sounds that were placed electronically on both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, most of them being sounds from life on Earth such as the sound of crickets, frogs, dogs and natural occurances like volcanos, fire, and thunder.

    			<p>This is a side view of the phonograph depicted in the picture above. The binary numbers underneath the picture is meant to show the time it takes to play one side, which is about one hour.</p>

                <p>Fun fact, in July 2015, NASA uploaded all of the audio contents of the Golden Record on Soundcloud, a quick Google search will take you to it!</p>

        	<p>This star looking shape is a diagram that shows the location of our solar system in reference to 14 known pulsars. The dashed lines on the diagram is meant to define the frequency of the pulses.</p>

            <p>Pulsars are highly magnetic neutron stars, which is sometime a byproduct of a star going supernova. Their core condenses into an extremely dense body. Pulsars radiate two beams of light opposite of each other, and it's rotational spin give the illusion on earth that the pulsar is flickering on and off.</p>

            <p>Interesting fact, pulsars were first discovered in 1967 and both Voyager probes were launched in 1977, 10 years apart!

            <p>The binary numbers below the signal note signal 1, 2, and 3 to distinguish three distinct signals. </p>

The line connecting the two atoms with the number 1 is meant to be interpreted that the time it takes for one state to transition to the other is the unit of time. This measurement of time is used for playing the record as well as generating the images.</p>
